-   **Linting**: Ensures code style and quality standards are met.
-   **Build**: Verifies that the application builds successfully.
-   **Docker Build**: Confirms that the Docker image can be built without errors.

These checks are run automatically on every `push` and `pull_request` to the `main` branch across multiple operating systems:
-   Ubuntu (latest)
-   macOS (latest)
-   Windows (latest)

## Containerisation

A `Dockerfile` is included to containerise the application for easy deployment.
