During my internship at Endace, I was tasked with developing a templatable profile system for their internal management system. The original requirement was to build the backend using Flask, but after researching and evaluating several frameworks, I proposed using FastAPI instead due to its asynchronous support, automatic documentation, and cleaner syntax for defining APIs. This meant stepping out of my comfort zone, as I hadnâ€™t used FastAPI before. However, I decided to self-learn it quickly by diving into documentation and small test projects to ensure I could implement it confidently. I also prepared a meeting highlighting the benefits of FastAPI over Flask for this specific use case, which helped gain approval from the senior team.  

Beyond the backend, I recognised that the user interface could be more intuitive than initially planned. So, outside my assigned scope, I taught myself Bootstrap and jQuery to design a dynamic, responsive form that allowed users to create complex profile templates with ease. Also, I ensured close alignment between frontend and backend by integrating both sides myself and documenting everything clearly in Confluence for future reference.  

The result was a solution that was not only technically robust but also user-friendly and well-received by the team. Through this experience, I learned how much impact I could make by questioning assumptions, taking ownership, and investing in new skills. I am excited to bring these qualities to a mission-driven company like [].
