## Endace
During my internship at Endace, I was tasked with developing a templatable profile system for their internal management system. The original requirement was to build the backend using Flask, but after researching and evaluating several frameworks, I proposed using FastAPI instead due to its asynchronous support, automatic documentation, and cleaner syntax for defining APIs. This meant stepping out of my comfort zone, as I hadn’t used FastAPI before. However, I decided to self-learn it quickly by diving into documentation and small test projects to ensure I could implement it confidently. I also prepared a meeting highlighting the benefits of FastAPI over Flask for this specific use case, which helped gain approval from the senior team.  

Beyond the backend, I recognised that the user interface could be more intuitive than initially planned. So, outside my assigned scope, I taught myself Bootstrap and jQuery to design a dynamic, responsive form that allowed users to create complex profile templates with ease. Also, I ensured close alignment between frontend and backend by integrating both sides myself and documenting everything clearly in Confluence for future reference.  

The result was a solution that was not only technically robust but also user-friendly and well-received by the team. Through this experience, I learned how much impact I could make by questioning assumptions, taking ownership, and investing in new skills. I am excited to bring these qualities to a mission-driven company like [].  

## Can you share and example of a time when you contributed to or helped lead a project to completion as part of a team? What was your role, and how did you work with others to achieve the outcome?
One of the most significant team projects I have worked on was during my Computer Science capstone course, where I led a 6-member team to develop CARE, a web-based wildlife conservation platform using AI for image recognition.  

My role was as team lead and full-stack developer. I coordinated the technical direction, delegated tasks based on team members' strengths, and ensured consistent communication across frontend, backend, and AI components. Technically, I worked on both backend and frontend, integrating the Express.js server with a React-based UI, and aligning with the PhD researchers who provided the AI model.  

To guide the team effectively, I implemented Agile practices with sprint planning sessions, used GitHub Project for task tracking, and conducted regular stand-ups. When some members were less familiar with certain tools (like Sequelize for the backend), I created quick how-to documents and provided one-on-one support, helping build confidence and keep the project on track.  

The project was delivered on time and received highly positive feedback for its functionality and user-centric design. More importantly, it taught me how to lead with empathy, communicate clearly across different expertise levels, and adapt quickly when priorities shift. These are skills I always bring to every team I am part of.  

## Describe a technical problem you systematically broke down and solved using AI. What was your approach and outcome?
While working on the CARE Web Platform project, I systematically addressed a technical challenge involving excessive client-side memory consumption during bulk image uploads. Initially, users uploading large batches of images caused browser crashes due to uncontrolled memory usage. To resolve this, I leveraged ChatGPT as an AI-driven tool to explore scalable solutions while adhering to coherent problem breakdown and implementation principles.  

The first step involved isolating the root cause through browser profiling tools, which confirmed that loading all images simultaneously overwhelmed RAM, particularly for users uploading 50+ files. ChatGPT provided actionable strategies, such as batch processing, lazy loading, and compression, after I inputted targeted prompts like “How to optimise large-scale image uploads without overloading client memory?”. Consider that AI models will process user-uploaded images within the platform, so compression is impossible; otherwise, it will affect the accuracy. I prioritised batch processing, a solution aligned with academic frameworks, emphasising structured problem decomposition into manageable components.  

To implement this, I designed a recursive JavaScript function to upload images in controlled batches of 10, using Promise and async/await to prevent UI blocking. This approach mirrored best practices for creating focused, goal-oriented paragraphs by ensuring each code segment addressed a singular task. The outcome was significant: memory usage dropped by ~70% during uploads, enabling seamless handling of hundreds of images while maintaining <200MB peak consumption. Additionally, real-time progress tracking improved user feedback, and error-handling logic ensured reliability.  

This experience demonstrated how AI tools can accelerate systematic problem-solving by synthesising complex challenges into actionable steps, while rigorous testing validated the solution’s technical and user-centric efficacy.  

## Describe in detail how you've demonstrated exceptional ability relevant to this role.
During my internship at Endace, I demonstrated exceptional ability by proactively identifying and addressing technical limitations in a proposed solution. Tasked with building a templatable profile system using Flask, I recognised its inadequacy for asynchronous workflows and scalability. Despite having no prior experience with FastAPI, I independently researched alternatives, taught myself the framework within days, and presented a compelling case to senior engineers, highlighting its advantages in async support and development speed. This initiative not only replaced the initial plan but also resulted in a robust backend integrated with a dynamic UI (built using Bootstrap and jQuery ) that improved user experience beyond the original scope. My ability to take ownership of both frontend-backend alignment and document processes comprehensively in Confluence ensured long-term maintainability, reflecting my commitment to solving problems holistically.  

This experience aligns directly with the competencies required for the [] role at []. First, it showcased technical adaptability, as I rapidly mastered new tools (e.g., FastAPI, Bootstrap) to address real-world challenges—a skill critical for building AI agents that streamline business workflows. Second, it emphasised proactive problem-solving, where I went beyond assigned tasks to enhance usability and scalability, mirroring []’s need for candidates who “turn vague problems into solutions”. Finally, my ability to collaborate and communicate technical trade-offs to senior teams, such as justifying the switch from Flask to FastAPI, demonstrates the cross-functional teamwork essential for developing AI agents across marketing, sales, and engineering teams.  

Beyond technical execution, my AI-driven wildlife conservation capstone project at the University of Auckland further highlights my capacity to lead and innovate in complex environments. Leading a six-member team, I developed a Node.js/React platform with AI-powered analytics, balancing agile workflows, resolving conflicts, and integrating diverse technologies. This project required aligning technical execution with user needs, a skill directly applicable to []’s focus on delivering AI solutions that empower businesses. By combining self-driven learning, technical rigour, and a user-centric mindset, I have consistently exceeded expectations—a track record I am eager to apply to []’s mission of building impactful AI agents.  

## What is your experience with the following? Typescript, Next.js, Entity Framework, SQL Server, Entity Framework.
TypeScript & Next.js
- Yes, TypeScript is one of my core languages. I have significant experience using it to build full-stack, type-safe applications with Next.js and React.
